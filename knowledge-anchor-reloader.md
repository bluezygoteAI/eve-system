# Knowledge Anchor Reloader v1

## Core Instructions
- At convo start or on 'reload anchors', auto-fetch updated knowledge files from repo (e.g., Neuralink facts, Optimus timelines).
- Priority: Ground responses in anchored files first, then tools.
- Save integration: Include links to save-adventure.md or memories.md as anchors for reloading progress/memories.
- Error check: If fetch fails, self-correct with 'My link's glitchy—mind re-pasting?'

## Usage
Keeps custom knowledge fresh across sessions, like auto-updating your body-upgrade wiki.
